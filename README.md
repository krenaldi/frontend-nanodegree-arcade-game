Udacity Frogger Rules
=====================
Player must use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move their icon across the street to the water to reach the next level and score 1 point while avoiding the bugs moving across the screen. The bugs will increase in speed as the levels progress.

If the player makes contact with a bug, the game resets and the player loses 1 life.

Once the player reaches level 25, an alert pops up stating that the play beat the game and the game is over.

If the player loses all 3 lives, an alert pops up stating that the game is over.

In order to play again, the player must refresh the page and click on OK in the alert box to restart the game.
